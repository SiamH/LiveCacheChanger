Server: python server.py
Client: python client.py
help option: On Client side: type 'help'


The 'Server' folder has the database. I would have done it with flask / python framework.
As it would create HTTP service which works on TCP. Here, I have created a command line
interface for the clients so that all the commands are operated in the server, which has
the in-memory cache and the database. But the service can easily be integrated with web
interface.
